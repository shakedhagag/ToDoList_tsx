This project was made through a type-script course. I wanted to learn the basics of typescript and it seemed like a good fit.
This is a simple, yet cool to do list.

🍀I have used react-beatiful-dnd which made the drag&drop features so easy and applicable.

🧑‍🎨And as for the icons I used react-icons/ai, an awesome library for projects like this.
